    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I'm an administrative professional with over 15 years of experience in grants management and development. I recently decided to make a career change to pursue a different kind of development - web development! I've officially joined the exciting world of software development and coding!
      
      I believe that life is to be lived well and without too many regrets. It is important to discover what we are meant to do with the one life we have and learn how to make an excellent living doing what we excel at and what we love.</p>

  <h1> Where I'm From</h1>
  <p>I was born in Guyana, the only English-speaking country in South America. During my teens I lived on the Caribbean island of St.Vincent and the Grenadines. Even though I've lived most of my life in the US, I still have my Caribbean accent and love Caribbean food and culture.</p>
